Here is some text I want to read with node.js.
There are 2 ways to readFile syncronously(blocking way) or asyncronously.
Asyncronously is the more popular way, when other commands can be prosessed while program is reading the file. 
And when done call back function is executed and text printed.



THIS TEKST IS FROM THE TEST2 FILE!
